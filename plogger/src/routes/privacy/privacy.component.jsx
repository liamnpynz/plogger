        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          PPlogger is a personal project site provided mainly for use as an
          example of my web development abilities. I am committed to preserving
          all Personal Information that is recorded by any users of the site in
          accordance with law. I have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles
          (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The
          NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure
          and dispose of your Personal Information. A copy of the Australian
          Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of
          the Australian Information Commissioner at www.aoic.gov.au

        <h2>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h2>
        <p>
          Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an
          individual. Examples of Personal Information we collect include:
          names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers. This
          Personal Information is obtained in many ways including by you signing
          up via Google, and by you logging your workout data to the database.
          We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of
          providing our services to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your Personal Information will not be disclosed to any other person.
        </p>

        <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably
          protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access,
          modification or disclosure, but we reserve the right to delete your
          information at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>Access to your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may access the Personal Information we hold about you directly by
          viewing your workout details in the account section. The only
          additional data held is the date that you registered, and any
          additional information such as your email, display name, and profile
          picture provided when you sign in via Google. This may be requested at
          any time by email to me@liampy.com and will be deleted upon request.
        </p>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy may change from time to time and is available on our
          website.
